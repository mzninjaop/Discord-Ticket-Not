## What is this?

Discord Tickets is a Discord bot for creating and managing ticket channels. It is a free and open-source alternative to the paid "premium" and "white-label" plans of popular ticketing bots, such as [Ticket Tool](https://tickettool.xyz/), [TicketsBot](https://ticketsbot.net/), [Tickety](https://tickety.net/), [Helper.gg](https://helper.gg/), [Helper](https://helper.wtf), and others.

Discord Tickets is feature-rich and much more customisable than many of the bots mentioned above. As it is intended for self-hosting, the bot can have your community/company's logo, for free.

Although intended for use in a single Discord server, the bot can also function in multiple servers at once if you run more than one community.

### Features

Discord Tickets is packed full of features, many of which were suggested by its users. If it's missing a feature you want, you can:

- Create a plugin for it, if you can code JavaScript
- Request someone else to make a plugin
- [Submit a feature request](https://github.com/discord-tickets/.github/blob/main//CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-feature-request) if you think many other users would benefit from it

Here's some of the things that makes Discord Tickets awesome:

1. **Highly customisable**  
Some messages can be configured for each server and for each ticket category. Every other message is set in the locale files, making it relatively easy to override the default messages.
You can also configure the functionality of the bot to your liking and add commands with plugins.

2. **Localisable**  
If the bot hasn't already been translated to your (community's) language, you can [translate](https://github.com/discord-tickets/.github/blob/main//CONTRIBUTING.md#translating) it yourself.
Plugin authors are encouraged to support multiple languages as well.

3. **Multiple ticket categories**  
Each ticket category has its own settings for messages and the support team roles. There's also multiple methods of creating a ticket.

4. **A beautiful ticket archives portal**  
**\[COMING SOON\] :** Add the official [Discord Tickets Portal](https://github.com/discord-tickets/portal) plugin for an instant ticket archives website.

    You can use [text transcripts](https://discordtickets.app/plugins/official/text-transcripts/) whilst you wait for the portal.

5. **Open-source and self-hosted**  
It's yours, you have full control.
